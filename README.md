Linux system related codes, scripts and patches

The directory structure follows the regular Gentoo/Debian root directory tree,
with the following exceptions:
- *kernel*: here I store the Linux kernel related drivers/patches
  (instead of /usr/src).
- *home*: data stored here on a live system would be under /home/user

**Note**: scripts/patches/drivers might not be compatible with all
distributions and/or kernel versions.
