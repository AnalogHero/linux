Linux system related codes, scripts and patches

The directory structure follows the regular Gentoo/Debian root directory tree.
The only notable exception is the kernel folder, where I store the Linux kernel
related drivers/patches (instead of /usr/src).

Note: scripts/patches/drivers might not be compatible with all distributions
and/or kernel versions.
